    <p>Hi! My name's Julia Lyons and I'm a sophomore at the University of Colorado.</p>
    <p>I'm aquiring a Bachelors of Science in Advertising with a minor in Creative Technology Design.</p>
    <p>I'm from San Francisco, CA and have been loving my time in Colorado, doing a lot of skiing, hiking, and learning how to snowboard.</p>
    <p>In this course, I hope to become more comfortable with coding and digital work in general.</p>
